## Installing

1. Hop over to http://ai2.appinventor.mit.edu/ and either create an account or sign into a pre-existing account.
2. Download the contents of this repo, and unzip it. (If you don't know how to do this, you shouldn't be using this software)
3. Go back to the tab you opened before and select Projects > Import project (.aia) from your computer.
4. Upload the `chromebox.aia` file you just downloaded and unzipped.
5. Wait for the project to load.
6. Hop over to the Play Store and search for MIT AI2 Companion
7. Install the Companion. If it isn't whitelisted on your Chromebook, ask an admin. Usually, they'll unblock it, as it is just a coding resource for people to learn how to code. Admins are so gullible >:)
8. Once installed, pop back to the AI2 tab.
9. Click Connect > Chromebook
10. In the tab that opens, check the box saying "Remember my choice" and click "Open".
11. Enjoy, and remember to abide by the terms of the MIT License!
